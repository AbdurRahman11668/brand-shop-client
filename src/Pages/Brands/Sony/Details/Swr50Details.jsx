                pdate: Almost four years after the Smartwatch 3 was released,
                Sony's last top-end wearable is very difficult to find on sale.
                The company hasn't updated the watch to Android Wear 2.0 or Wear
                OS and its general age makes this a very difficult watch to
                recommend searching for in 2018.
                <br />
                The company has shown no intention of releasing a Sony
                SmartWatch 4 either, so if you want a smartwatch from Sony you
                may be disappointed and you can also take a look at our guide to
                the best Wear OS watches right now. <br />
                The Sony SmartWatch 3 is more than just a smartwatch, it's also
                got ambitions as a capable fitness watch, thanks to the
                inclusion of GPS.
                <br />
                It doesn't make the most stunning first impression, especially
                when compared to the more traditional circular stylings of the
                Moto 360 and Huawei Watch. The Sony SmartWatch 3 rocks a square
                shape that's more similar to the Pebble Time than other Android
                Wear devices.
                <br />
                But, where its appearance might fall flat, it surprises in other
                ways. For one thing, the mere fact that it runs Android Wear is
                a bit of a shock, given that Sony has spent the last few years
                shying away from it, attempting to perfect its own system
                instead.
                <br />
                But it's a decision that I welcome. Android Wear is still
                finding its footing and with Sony jumping into the mix can only
                be a good thing.
                <br />
                Its 1.2GHz quad-core processor and 512MB of RAM pack it with
                power, even to today's standards. And with GPS built in, it's a
                more fully-functional fitness accessory than most other
                smartwatches available. <br />
                Of course, all that power doesn't come cheap, as the Sony
                SmartWatch 3 retails for Â£189.99 (about US$250, AU$299.99).
                However, if you do some digging, you can probably find yourself
                a big discount.
                <br />
                All in all, it's not quite the most expensive smartwatch. The
                aforementioned Moto 360 and Huawei Watch both edge it out,
                seemingly charging a premium for a circular, fashionable
                styling.
