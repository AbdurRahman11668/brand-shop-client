              While the Apple AirPod Max is a great pair of headphones with best-in-class active noise canceling (ANC) and a good sound signature, it also has a few annoying quirks that make it very obviously an Apple product. If you live in the Apple ecosystem and already love your AirPods Pro, then the AirPods Max is more of the same just in a pair of over-ears.
              <br />
              Nice design and solid build quality <br />
Amazing active noise canceling and transparency mode <br />
Comfortable ear pads and fabric headband <br />
Decent battery life <br />
Button and digital crown are great to use <br />
Good sound quality with no distortion <br />
Great connection strength with Bluetooth 5.0 <br />
Ever since acquiring Beats by Dre for an ungodly amount of money in 2014, itâ€™s been obvious Apple has its eye on the consumer audio space. The original AirPods was a hit despite being terrible, and the AirPods Pro is actually among the best true wireless earbuds you can get. So when Apple announced its long-awaited over-ears, the AirPods Max, we were excited but skeptical.
