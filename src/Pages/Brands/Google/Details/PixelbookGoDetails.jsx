                M1 chip offers a performance boost. Front-facing camera comes
                with Center Stage. 5G connectivity (sub-6 only). Solid battery

                The 2022 iPad Air sports nearly the same bezel-free design, a
                10.9-inch display with 500 nits of brightness, a Touch ID top
                button, USB-C port, 12-megapixel rear camera, and an array of
                vibrant colors. And while repetition is typically prone to
                criticism, the iPad Airâ€™s redesign is still fresh enough that
                this new Air doesn't feel boring. The colorful tablet has a
                sleek look that begs to be carried around without a case.{" "}

              <p className="text-gray-600 font-medium">
                But if you do want to use a case for additional protection,
                Apple's proprietary smart connector on the back allows you to
                magnetically attach the iPad to Apple's Smart Keyboard, Smart
                Folio, and Magic Keyboard. And since the new iPad Air has the
                exact same dimensions as the 2020 version, you won't have to buy
                new accessories if you're upgrading.{" "}
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 font-medium">
                It's also worth noting that if you want to get the most out of
                your slim new computer and enjoy the complete iPad Air
                experience, you'll have to splurge for the Magic Keyboard ($299)
                and second-generation Apple Pencil ($129). Adding those things
                to the $599 64-GB iPad Air brings your total to $1,028.
                Meanwhile, the M1-powered MacBook Air starts at $999. So you
                might want to look into third-party accessories.

                The iPad Air comes with 5G connectivity. It doesn't have support
                for the faster millimeter-wave 5G service, but it supports the
                more prevalent sub-6 5G networks, which give you a slight speed
                boost over LTE. To get the 5G connectivity you will of course
                have to purchase the cellular model of the iPad Air, which
                starts at $749. On top of that, you'll need a cellular plan.{" "}
